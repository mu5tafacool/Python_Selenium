# CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python in Automation Testing

#### Description:

**Decision of the CS50P course, final project idea by Harvard:**
The idea of creating the project is similar to my choice of profession. So, I decided to create automation with python programming language. The program language must be used with a tool to work. I thought about adding a package to the project. Automation tool that I use in Java programming language, at the end of the research. I decided to use [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) package. I found a library called **Automation Cs50p** to help me do this project, and there was also a need for other packages. It automatically adds the browser driver to the project with the [webdriver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) package after Run. [pytest-selenium](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-selenium/) is a plugin for pytest and it allows to test the selenium based project.

This project is to automation the course website using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).

#

- ## This Acceptable Criteria
  ### Purpose of the test:
  > - Accessing the member course site.
  > - Watching a course introduction video.
  > - See the weekly course materials.
  > - Accessing and seeing each week's problem sets.

---

- To begin, you can install request modules with their methods:

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run automation program with:

```
    python project.py
```

- Run your tests by executing:

```
    python -m  pytest test_project.py
```

## Project steps

---

### [project.py](https://github.com/me50/mu5tafacool/blob/main/project/project.py)

> Run on beginning

    - Installing a browser to work
    - The second run method maximizes the browser window by webdriver method

After Run

> - The browser goes to the [course site](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)
> - Opens and closes the [introduction video](https://youtu.be/OvKCESUCWII) of the course in full screen
> - Opening the elements panel to [inspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development_tools) on browser, then creating locators by using the [`find_element` method](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/)
> - The time has been set to wait for the web pages to be opened by until method of [`WebDriverWait class`](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/support/wait.py)
> - Click on the course [weeks material page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/)
> - Click on the [problem set page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/) for the first week (week 0)
> - With for loops, `find_elements` of week problem set
> - Every problem page of the first week is checked by Improving with User Input (`while True:`)
> - Write the problem set list of each weekly lesson in a [txt file](https://github.com/me50/mu5tafacool/blob/main/project/lists_of_problem_set.txt) with for loops
> - This file is printed by `print` function
> - These procedures are done to write in the order of weeks
> - Control so a member can access all materials
> - All of the functions on the main function are running in the correct order
> - In particular, I took special care to create dynamic for looking at problem sets and weekly courses.

### Automation is done in approximately a few minutes, but manual control takes more time. There is a possibility of manual user error.

## Unit tests

---

Used to check whether all the functions in the code are working as expected. The pytest-selenium plugin provides functionality with browser work for tests.

### [test_project.py](https://github.com/me50/mu5tafacool/blob/main/project/test_project.py)

These are the tests implemented:

```ruby
def test_url():
```

- Showing [Welcome page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

```ruby
def test_week0():
```

- User should be able to click on Week 0 Functions page then check

```ruby
def test_problem_set_page():
```

- used to check if the specified position is free to insert marker

```ruby
def test_problems_of_week():
```

- Check each problems on:
  <details><summary>Week 0</summary>
  <p>

  #### Improving with User Input (`while True:`) with dynamic function

  - [Indoor Voice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/indoor/)
  - [Playback Speed](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/playback/)
  - [Making Faces](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/faces/)
  - [Einstein](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/einstein/)
  - [Tip Calculator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/tip/)
